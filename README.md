## About
US to UK English Converter is a free tool that allows you to quickly and easily convert text from American English to British English. Simply paste or type your American English text into the input box, and the tool will automatically transform it to the equivalent British English.

The tool handles a wide range of differences between the two dialects, including spelling variations (e.g., "color" to "colour", "analyze" to "analyse"), vocabulary differences (e.g., "elevator" to "lift", "cookie" to "biscuit"), and grammar nuances. It's perfect for writers, students, translators, or anyone who needs to adapt their text for a British audience.
